**Problem 1: (2 pts)** 

Use the color picker app from the **colorspace** package (`colorspace::choose_color()`) to create a qualitative color scale containing four colors. One of the four colors should be `#4D670C`, so you need to find three additional colors that go with this one. Use the function `swatchplot()` to plot your colors. `swatchplot()` takes in a vector of colors. 

```{r}
# creating a color space
#colorspace::choose_color()

palette <- c("#4D670C", "#25638D", "#70518E", "#7A5817")

swatchplot(palette)
```


**Problem 2: (4 pts)** 

For this problem, we will work with the `midwest2` dataset (derived from `midwest`). In the following plot, you may notice that the axis tick labels are smaller than the axis titles, and also in a different color (gray instead of black). 

1. Use the colors you chose in Problem 1 to color the points.
2. Make the axis tick labels the same size (`size = 12`) and give them the color black (`color = "black"`)
3. Set the entire plot background to the color `"#FBF9F6"`. Make sure there are no white areas remaining, such as behind the plot panel or under the legend.

```{r}
ggplot(midwest2, aes(popdensity, percollege, fill = state)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, color = "white", stroke = 0.2) +
  scale_x_log10(name = "population density") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "percent college educated") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) +
  theme_classic(12) +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(
      size = 12,
      color = "black"
    ),
    plot.background = element_rect(
      fill = "#FBF9F6"
    ),
    panel.background = element_rect(
      fill = "#FBF9F6"
    ),
    legend.box.background = element_rect(
      fill = "#FBF9F6", 
      color = "#FBF9F6"
    )
  )
```



**Problem 3: (4 pts)** 

For this problem, we will work with the `oceanbuoys` dataset from the `naniar` library that contains west pacific tropical atmosphere ocean data for 1993 and 1997. 

Write a function that converts temperature from Celcius to Fahrenheit. Then, use this function and any other data wrangling code you learned from class to make a summary table of average sea temperature and air temperature (in Fahrenheit) for 1997 and 1993. The formula for converting Celcius to Fahrenheit is `Fahrenheit = (Celcius*1.8) + 32`. 
```{r}
f2c <- function(oldvar){
  oceanbuoys |>
    mutate(new_var = (.data$oldvar*1.8) + 32
    )
}

oceanbuoys_table <-
  oceanbuoys |>
    filter(year > 1993, year < 1997)

summary(oceanbuoys)
```
